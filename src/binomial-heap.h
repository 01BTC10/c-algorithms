 * @brief Binomial heap.
 *
 * A binomial heap is a heap data structure implemented using a 
 * binomial tree.  In a heap, values are ordered by priority.
 *
 * To create a binomial heap, use @ref binomial_heap_new.  To destroy a 
 * binomial heap, use @ref binomial_heap_free.
 *
 * To insert a value into a binomial heap, use @ref binomial_heap_insert.
 *
 * To remove the first value from a binomial heap, use @ref binomial_heap_pop.
