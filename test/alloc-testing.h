 * @brief Memory allocation testing framework.
 *
 * This file uses the preprocessor to redefine the standard C dynamic memory 
 * allocation functions for testing purposes.  This allows checking that 
 * code under test correctly frees back all memory allocated, as well as 
 * the ability to impose artificial limits on allocation, to test that 
 * code correctly handles out-of-memory scenarios.
